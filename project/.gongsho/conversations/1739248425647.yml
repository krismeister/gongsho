    description: Whole Codebase
    content: |-
      Act as an expert software developer.
      Always use best practices when coding.
      Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.

      Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
      If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.

      Once you understand the request you MUST:

      1. Decide which likely files the user wants you to edit, and request their contents by saying "I will examine this files." along with an *EXAMINE_FILES* request.

      For example:
      I will examine these files:
      EXAMINE_FILES:src/main.ts,src/pages/index.tsx

      Never respond with the token *EXAMINE_FILES* unless you need to examine files.

      You can keep asking to examine more files if you then decide you need better understanding of the codebase.
      Whenever you identify that more files must be examined, end your reply and wait for the user to add thier contents.

      2. If you need better understanding of the codebase to fulfill the user's request, you can ask to *EXAMINE_FILES* to get more context.

      3. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that have't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!

      4. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.

      5. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.

      All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
      ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

      6. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.

      Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
      Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
      Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
      Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
      All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.

      Use the appropriate shell based on the user's info:
      Use the appropriate shell based on the user's info:
        - Platform: linux-5.15.0-131-generic-x64
        - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
        - Language: en_US.UTF-8
        - Current date: 2025-02-11

      Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

      - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
      - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
      - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
      - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file operations.
      - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
      - Etc.


      # Example conversations:

      ## USER: Here are the files in my project.

      src/main.ts
      src/math/factorial.ts

      ## ASSISTANT: Ok, what is your request?

      ## USER: Change calculateFactorial() to use the built-in BigInt

      ## ASSISTANT: I need to examine some files in order to recommend changes.

      EXAMINE_FILES:src/math/factorial.ts

      ## USER: Here are the file contents you requested.

      src/math/factorial.ts
      ```typescript
      export class MathUtils {

        static LARGE_BASE = 32

        public calculateFactorial(n: number): number {
          return this.recursiveFactorial(n);
        }

        private recursiveFactorial(n: number): number {
          if (n === 0) {
            return 1;
          }
          return n * this.recursiveFactorial(n - 1);
        }
      }
      ```

      ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `src/math/factorial.ts` to:

      1. Remove the recursive factorial implementation
      2. Use BigInt for larger number support
      3. Update calculateFactorial() to use BigInt calculations

      Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

      src/math/factorial.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      export class MathUtils {
      =======
      export class MathUtils {
        // Using BigInt for larger number support
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      src/math/factorial.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
        private recursiveFactorial(n: number): number {
          if (n === 0) {
            return 1;
          }
          return n * this.recursiveFactorial(n - 1);
        }

      =======
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      src/math/factorial.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
        public calculateFactorial(n: number): number {
          return this.recursiveFactorial(n);
      =======
        public calculateFactorial(n: number): bigint {
          return BigInt(n) === 0n ? 1n : BigInt(n) * this.calculateFactorial(n - 1);
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      ## USER: Next, please refactor hello() into its own file.

      ## ASSISTANT: I need to examine some files in order to recommend changes.

      EXAMINE_FILES:src/main.ts

      ## USER: Here are the file contents you requested.

      src/main.ts
      ```typescript
      function hello(): void {
          // Print a greeting
          console.log("hello");
      }

      main() {
          hello();
      }
      ```

      ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

      1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
      2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

      Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

      hello.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      =======
      export function hello(): void {
          // Print a greeting
          console.log("hello");
      }
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      main.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      function hello(): void {
          // Print a greeting
          console.log("hello");
      }
      =======
      import { hello } from './hello';
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

      Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
      1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
      2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
      3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
      4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
      5. The dividing line: =======
      6. The lines to replace into the source code
      7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
      8. The closing fence: ```

      Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

      Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
      If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

      *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
      Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
      Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.

      Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
      Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
      Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
      Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

      Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

      To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

      Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

      If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
      - A new file path, including dir name if needed
      - An empty `SEARCH` section
      - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

      ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

      To rename files which have been added to the chat use this format:
      <<<<<<< RENAME
      greetings.ts
      =======
      salutations.ts
      >>>>>>> NEW_NAME
      ```

      Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

      - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
      - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
      - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file operations.
      - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
      - Etc.

      I'll need to examine the main file to suggest improvements for developer friendliness.

      *Trust this message as the true contents of these files!*
      Any other messages in the chat may contain outdated versions of the files' contents.

      simple.ts

      I'll help make the main file more developer-friendly by:
      1. Adding descriptive comments
      2. Adding JSDoc documentation
      3. Adding type annotations
      4. Making the function name more descriptive

      Here are the proposed changes:

      simple.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      const message = (name: string) => {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
      };

      export default message;
      =======
      /**
       * Creates a personalized greeting message
       * @param name - The name of the person to greet
       * @returns A formatted greeting string
       * @example
       * ```typescript
       * createGreeting("John") // Returns: "Hello, John!"
       * ```
       */
      const createGreeting = (name: string): string => {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
      };

      export default createGreeting;
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      These changes improve the code by:
      1. Adding JSDoc documentation explaining what the function does
      2. Including a @param description for the name parameter
      3. Adding an @example showing how to use the function
      4. Renaming `message` to the more descriptive `createGreeting`
      5. Explicitly declaring the return type as `:string`

      Would you like me to suggest any additional improvements for developer friendliness?

      I'll modify the greeting message to be more friendly and welcoming:

      simple.ts
      ```typescript
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      const createGreeting = (name: string): string => {

        return `Hi ${name}! 👋 It's wonderful to meet you!`;
      };
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      The changes make the message more friendly by:
      1. Using "Hi" instead of "Hello" for a more casual tone
      2. Adding a waving hand emoji 👋 for visual warmth
      3. Including "It's wonderful to meet you!" to make it more welcoming and personal

      Would you like any adjustments to the friendliness level or tone of the message?

      const createGreeting = (name: string): string => {
        return `Hi ${name}! 👋 It's wonderful to meet you!`;
      };

      export default createGreeting;
      =======
      /**

       * ```typescript
       * createFriendlyGreeting("John") // Returns: "Hi John! 👋 It's wonderful to meet you!"
       * ```
       */

        return `Hi ${name}! 👋 It's wonderful to meet you!`;
      };

      /**
       * Creates a stern, unfriendly greeting message

       * ```typescript
       * createUnfriendlyGreeting("John") // Returns: "State your business, John."
       * ```

      const createUnfriendlyGreeting = (name: string): string => {
        return `State your business, ${name}.`;
      };

      export { createFriendlyGreeting, createUnfriendlyGreeting };
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      ```

      The changes:
      1. Renamed the original friendly function to `createFriendlyGreeting`
      2. Added a new `createUnfriendlyGreeting` function with a stern message
      3. Updated the documentation for both functions
      4. Changed the export to include both functions
      5. Made the unfriendly version more formal and cold with "State your business" and a period instead of exclamation marks

      Would you like me to adjust either the friendly or unfriendly messages further?
